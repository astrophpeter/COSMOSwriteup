%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}


%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN PACKAGES HERE %%%%%

% Only include extra packages if you really need them. Common packages are:
\usepackage{graphicx}	% Including figure files
\usepackage{amsmath}	% Advanced maths commands
\usepackage{amssymb}	% Extra maths symbols

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%% AUTHORS - PLACE YOUR OWN COMMANDS HERE %%%%%

% Please keep new commands to a minimum, and use \newcommand not \def to avoid
% overwriting existing commands. Example:
%\newcommand{\pcm}{\,cm$^{-2}$}	% per cm-squared

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TITLE PAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Title of the paper, and the short title which is used in the headers.
% Keep the title short and informative.

% The list of authors, and the short list which is used in the headers.
% If you need two or more lines of authors, add an extra line using \newauthor

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

Starpy from becky's paper \cite{smethurst2015galaxy}.
Becky's group environment paper \cite{smethurst2017galaxy}.
UltraVista catalogue paper \cite{muzzin2013public}
\section{Data}
   
   \subsection{Multi-wavelength data}
   
   This study is based on a K$_{s}$-selected catalog of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field from \cite{muzzin2013public}.  
   The catalog contains PSF-matched photometry in 30 photometric bands covering the wavelength range 0.15$\micron$ 
   $\rightarrow$ 24$\micron$ and includes the available $GALEX$ \citep{martin2005}, CFHT/Subaru \citep{capak2007}, 
   UltraVISTA \citep{mcCraken2012}, S-COSMOS \citep{sanders2007}, and zCOSMOS \citep{lilly2009} datasets.

\section{Model}

   \begin{equation}
      \text{SFR}(t) = \begin{cases}
                \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q}) & t \leq t_{q} \\
                \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q})\exp\bigg[-\frac{(t-t_{q})}{\tau}\bigg] & t > t_{q} 
               \end{cases}
       \label{eq:model}
   \end{equation}

\section{Probalistic Fitting}


   \begin{equation}
      P(\theta_{k}) = \begin{cases}
                       1 & 0\leq t_{q}\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 13.8 \text{ and }  0 \leq \tau\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 4 \\
                       0 & \text{otherwise}
                      \end{cases}
      \label{eq:prior}
   \end{equation}
