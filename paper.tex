%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

Starpy from becky's paper \cite{smethurst2015galaxy}.
Becky's group environment paper \cite{smethurst2017galaxy}.
UltraVista catalogue paper \cite{muzzin2013public}
\section{Data}
   
   \subsection{Multi-wavelength data}
   
   This study is based on a K$_{s}$-selected catalog of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field from \cite{muzzin2013public}.  
   The catalog contains PSF-matched photometry in 30 photometric bands covering the wavelength range 0.15$\micron$ 
   $\rightarrow$ 24$\micron$ and includes the available $GALEX$ \citep{martin2005}, CFHT/Subaru \citep{capak2007}, 
   UltraVISTA \citep{mcCraken2012}, S-COSMOS \citep{sanders2007}, and zCOSMOS \citep{lilly2009} datasets.

   \begin{itemize}
   
   \item Used rest frame U-V and V-J colours provided by \cite{muzzin2013public}
   \item These were calculated using the EAZY code \cite{eazycode}, and the errors obtained from the error template in this paper.
   \item Filters for the bands: U,V Johnson filtres from \cite{maiz2006}, J - 2Mass Filter.
   \end{itemize}

   

   \subsection{Environment data}
   
   Environment data from \cite{darvish2015}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Method used is Weighted Voronoi Tessellation
      \item  Quote from darvish: Unlike the nearest neighbor, Voronoi tessellation is scale-independent and is able to span a wide range of physical lengths. Also, it
does not make any assumptions about the geometry and
morphology of the structures in the density field. This
characteristic makes it superior to adaptive kernel and
nearest neighbor methods.

       \item  Quote from Darvish: However, this comes at the expense
of a computationally expensive process by
making several Monte-Carlo samples. Apart from
its computational time, it is a robust estimator.

      \item formula: \begin{equation}\Sigma(r_{i})=\frac{1}{A_{i}}\end{equation}
   \end{itemize}


   \subsection{Galaxy Zoo Hubble Morphological classifications}
   
   In this investigation we use morphological classifications obtained from the Galaxy Zoo Hubble\footnote{\url{https://hubble.galaxyzoo.org}} (GZH) citizen 
   science project \citep{galaxyzooHubble}. GZH allowed serveral independant visual classifications of each galaxy image by volunteers, the question flowchart for each
   image is shown in figure 4 of \cite{galaxyzooHubble}.

   The GZH project consists of 119,849 images 
   
\section{Star Formation History Model}

   \begin{itemize}
    
      \item we use the publicaly available \textsc{starpy} code \footnote{\url{http://github.com/zooniverse/starpy/}}.
      \item  stellar population models from \cite{bruzual2003}
  
      \item implemented using solar metallicity

      \item implement with a Chabrier IMF \cite{chabrier2003}

      \item does not model for intrinsic dust.

      \item  assumption that all galaxies formed at t = 0 Gyr with 
             an initial burst of star formation
   \end{itemize}
 
   \begin{equation}
      \text{SFR}(t) = \begin{cases}
                \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q}) & t \leq t_{q} \\
                \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q})\exp\bigg[-\frac{(t-t_{q})}{\tau}\bigg] & t > t_{q} 
               \end{cases}
       \label{eq:model}
   \end{equation}



   

   \begin{equation}
      P(\theta_{k}) = \begin{cases}
                       1 & 0\leq t_{q}\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 13.8 \text{ and }  0 \leq \tau\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 4 \\
                       0 & \text{otherwise}
                      \end{cases}
      \label{eq:prior}
   \end{equation}
