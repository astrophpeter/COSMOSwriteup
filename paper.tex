%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

Starpy from becky's paper \cite{smethurst2015galaxy}.
Becky's group environment paper \cite{smethurst2017galaxy}.
UltraVista catalogue paper \cite{muzzin2013public}
\section{Data}
   
   \subsection{Multi-wavelength data}
   
   In this study we used the K$_{s}$-selected catalog of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field from \cite{muzzin2013public}.  
   The catalog contains PSF-matched photometry in 30 photometric bands covering the wavelength range 0.15$\micron$ 
   $\rightarrow$ 24$\micron$ and includes the available $GALEX$ \citep{martin2005}, CFHT/Subaru \citep{capak2007}, 
   UltraVISTA \citep{mcCraken2012}, S-COSMOS \citep{sanders2007}, and zCOSMOS \citep{lilly2009} datasets.

   \begin{itemize}
   
   \item Used rest frame U-V and V-J colours provided by \cite{muzzin2013public}
   \item These were calculated using the \textsc{EAZY} code \cite{eazycode}, and the errors obtained from the error template in this paper.
   \item Filters for the bands: U,V Johnson filtres from \cite{maiz2006}, J - 2Mass Filter from \cite{2mass2006}.
   \end{itemize}

   We required the rest-frame U - V and V - J colours found in \cite{muzzin2013public}, which
   were calculated using the \textsc{EAZY} code \citep{eazycode}. For the U and V filters
   the Johnson response curves calculated in \cite{maiz2006} were used. The J filter used the 
   2MASS response curve from \cite{2mass2006}.

   

   \subsection{Environment data}
   
   Environment data from \cite{darvish2015}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Method used is Weighted Voronoi Tessellation
      \item  Quote from darvish: Unlike the nearest neighbor, Voronoi tessellation is scale-independent and is able to span a wide range of physical lengths. Also, it
does not make any assumptions about the geometry and
morphology of the structures in the density field. This
characteristic makes it superior to adaptive kernel and
nearest neighbor methods.

       \item  Quote from Darvish: However, this comes at the expense
of a computationally expensive process by
making several Monte-Carlo samples. Apart from
its computational time, it is a robust estimator.

      \item formula: \begin{equation}\Sigma(r_{i})=\frac{1}{A_{i}}\end{equation}
   \end{itemize}


   \subsection{Galaxy Zoo Hubble Morphological classifications}
   
   Morphological classifications of galaxies were obtained from the Galaxy Zoo Hubble\footnote{\url{https://hubble.galaxyzoo.org}} (GZH) citizen 
   science project \citep{galaxyzooHubble}. GZH allowed several independent visual classifications of each galaxy image by volunteers, the question flowchart for each
   image is shown in Figure 4 of \cite{galaxyzooHubble}. The GZH project provides detailed classifications of 119,849 galaxies from publicly-released \textit{Hubble
   Space Telescope Legacy} programs conducted with the Advanced Camera for Surveys. In this study we used a subset of the total GZH sample corresponding to 84,954
   galaxies found in the COSMOS Survey \citep{scoville2007,koekemoer2007}.

\section{Methods}   

\subsection{Modelling Star Formation History}

We used the publically available \textsc{starpy}\footnote{\url{http://github.com/zooniverse/starpy/}}
code. \textsc{starpy} infers the star formation history (SFH) of a single galaxy by using Bayesian 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods \citep{mackey2013}. Inputs of redshift, rest-frame U - V and V - J colours, 
combined with the stellar population model of \cite{bruzual2003}, a solar metallicity, and a Chabrier
IMF \cite{chabrier2003} produces a SFH for a galaxy. These models do not account for intrinsic dust. 
An explanation of how \textsc{starpy} works can be found in section 3 of \cite{smethurst2015galaxy}.

The SFH model used is parameterised by $t_{q}$ and $\tau$ [Gyrs], where $t_{q}$ is the onset time of quenching
and $\tau$ characterises the rate of quenching. Increaing $\tau$ represents an exponetially slower quench. 
Assuming that all galaxies formed at $t=0$ [Gyrs] with an initial burst of constant SFR ($\text{SFR}_{0}$), 
we write the SFH over cosmic time ($0\leq t \text{ }[\text{Gyrs}]\leq 13.8$) as:

 \begin{equation}
       \text{SFR}(t) = \begin{cases}
                 \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q}) & t \leq t_{q} \\
                 \text{SFR}_{0}(t_{q})\exp\bigg[-\frac{(t-t_{q})}{\tau}\bigg] & t > t_{q} 
                \end{cases}
        \label{eq:model}
 \end{equation}

   

   \begin{equation}
      P(\theta_{k}) = \begin{cases}
                       1 & 0\leq t_{q}\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 13.8 \text{ and }  0 \leq \tau\text{ [Gyr] } \leq 4 \\
                       0 & \text{otherwise}
                      \end{cases}
      \label{eq:prior}
   \end{equation}
